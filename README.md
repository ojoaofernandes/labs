# Labs

## Welcome

Hi, my name is João Fernandes, and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.

This repository is a kind of code lab where I try to learn new programming languages, other paradigms, other ideas, and new technologies. Therefore, you might find efficient algorithms and crappy code without any style that makes no sense too.

Be my guest to explore and use this repository as you want, but remember that not all of these codes work fine.

I appreciate some tips, so feel free to contribute.
